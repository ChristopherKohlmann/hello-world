Simple Hello World Task for learning how to use GitHub


Learning new things is a wise way to live. At some point one will be full of wisdom and abel to answer all questions of the world, but still though questions like, "what do you want for dinner?", Will be the hardest questions to answer.

Hey World,

I'm Chris,

I love parrots, love to watch series and animes and  play a lot of videogames :D
But for real I am learning how to programm for my master thesis and work on a project, which has been developed during the past 7 years and has no comments or documentary at all and for gods sake I have to master this thing :D Therefore I learn proper programming skills, so no one who will be working at our physics chair has the same problems with my future projects, as I have to face now.
